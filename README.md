#codingChallenge

This code can handle many different csv files as arguments.

To run the program, navigate to the directory where the main.py file is located.

Run the command - python main.py excelFile1.csv excelFile2.csv excelFile3.csv

For instance,

    python main.py accessories.csv household_cleaners.csv clothing.csv
If there are more .csv files that need to be merged - place them into the project folder, and ensure that their columns are similar and they can be added to the argument list.

The output of the merged csv will be outputted to the console, and saved in a new file as combinedCSV.csv.
